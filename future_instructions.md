This github repository is for Koopman Sparse Autoencoders.

A Koopman Sparse Autoencoder would integrate the principles of Koopman autoencoders with mechanisms to promote **sparsity** in its latent representation or learned parameters. The goal is to achieve the core objective of Koopman theory – linearizing nonlinear dynamics in a lifted space – while also gaining the benefits of sparse representations, such as **interpretability** and the ability to capture **switching behaviors** in complex systems.

Based on the provided sources and the ideas from the LISTA algorithm, a Koopman Sparse Autoencoder might look like this:

### 1. Core Architecture (Koopman Autoencoder Foundation)

A Koopman Sparse Autoencoder would maintain the fundamental architecture of a deep Koopman autoencoder:
*   **Encoder ($\phi$)**: A nonlinear function (often a deep neural network) that maps the original high-dimensional state `xt` into a latent representation `zt`. This `zt` is the Koopman embedding.
*   **Latent Space**: A potentially higher-dimensional space where the dynamics are approximated as linear. The system's evolution here is `zt+1 ≈ K̂zt`. The sources note that Koopman autoencoders often use a latent space dimension `n` significantly larger than the original state dimension `d` (`n >> d`).
*   **Koopman Matrix ($\hat{K}$)**: A linear operator that advances the dynamics in the latent space.
*   **Decoder ($\psi$)**: A nonlinear function that reconstructs the original state `xt` from its latent representation `zt`.
*   **Training Objective**: The model is trained by minimizing a loss function that typically includes:
    *   **Reconstruction loss** (`∥xt − ψ(ϕ(xt))∥2`) to ensure accurate state reconstruction.
    *   **Alignment or Prediction loss** (`∥ϕ(xt+1)− K̂ϕ(xt)∥2`) to enforce the linearity of dynamics in the latent space. This can also be augmented with a `Prediction loss` of `∥xt+1 − ψ(ẑt+1)∥2` where `ẑt+1` is the predicted latent state.

### 2. Incorporating Sparsity

The "sparse" aspect would primarily be introduced in the **latent representation (`z`)** and potentially in the internal operations of the encoder/decoder, drawing inspiration from LISTA's methods for efficient sparse code approximation:

*   **Sparsity-Inducing Loss on Latent States**:
    *   Similar to how LISTA promotes sparse codes using an L1 penalty on the code vector `Z`, a Koopman Sparse Autoencoder would incorporate a **sparsity-inducing L1 loss** on the latent vector `z` (Koopman embeddings) during training. This encourages many components of `z` to become zero or near-zero, meaning only a few Koopman features are active at any given time.
    *   This L1 loss, referred to as `1e-3` in one source, aims to encourage "region-dedicated dynamics".

*   **Sparsity-Promoting Nonlinearities in the Encoder**:
    *   LISTA utilizes a component-wise **shrinkage function** (`hθ`) that explicitly promotes sparsity by thresholding values. An encoder `ϕ` for a Koopman Sparse Autoencoder could incorporate similar shrinkage functions or other sparsity-inducing activation functions (e.g., ReLU, which is mentioned as ensuring "sparse activations" in the context of Koopman embeddings) within its layers, or as a final activation, to directly encourage sparse `z` values.
    *   The "double tanh" function and the shrinkage function were found to perform best among tested nonlinearities for a baseline sparse code encoder.

*   **Learned Iterative Refinement and Mutual Inhibition in the Encoder**:
    *   LISTA's architecture is a "time-unfolded recurrent neural network" that iteratively refines the sparse code, incorporating "mutual inhibition" or "explaining away" between code components. A Koopman encoder could adopt a similar iterative, fixed-depth structure. This would allow the encoder to learn to activate only the most relevant Koopman features, making them compete to explain the input state `x`, thus leading to a more disentangled and sparse `z`.

### 3. Motivation for Sparsity in Koopman Autoencoders

The primary motivations for making a Koopman autoencoder sparse include:

*   **Interpretability**: Sparsity in the latent space (`z`) can lead to **more interpretable embeddings** where only a few dominant Koopman features are active, potentially corresponding to physically meaningful modes or dynamical regimes.
*   **Handling Switching Dynamics and Multiple Fixed Points**: A key limitation of standard Koopman autoencoders is their assumption of global linearity in the latent space, which struggles to capture dynamics that switch between multiple fixed points or distinct attractors.
    *   Sparsity can enable **"region-dedicated" latent codes**. For example, if the latent space `z` is high-dimensional (e.g., `z ∈ R^4` for `x ∈ R^2`), sparse codes can represent distinct attractors (e.g., two regions `R1` and `R2`) by activating different, non-overlapping subsets of latent components (e.g., `[z1, z2, 0, 0]` for `x ∈ R1` and `[0, 0, z3, z4]` for `x ∈ R2`). This allows different linear dynamics (`K1` and `K2`) to govern different regions of the phase space, implicitly capturing switching behavior that would otherwise be impossible with a single global linear Koopman operator.
    *   This is crucial because nonlinear systems can only be truly linearized within the basin of attraction of a fixed point, implying that the best approach might be to partition the phase space into regions, each approximated by a linear dynamical system (LDS).
*   **Managing High-Dimensional Latent Spaces**: While Koopman theory often lifts dynamics to a higher (even infinite) dimensional space to achieve linearity, sparsity ensures that only a few relevant dimensions are active at any given time, making the representation more tractable and efficient despite its potential size.

In summary, a Koopman Sparse Autoencoder would explicitly learn to transform a nonlinear system into a latent space where dynamics are linear and the representation is sparse, allowing it to provide more interpretable models and better handle complex behaviors like mode-switching between different dynamical regimes. This is achieved through sparsity-inducing loss functions, specialized nonlinear activations in the encoder, and potentially LISTA-inspired iterative refinement mechanisms.
